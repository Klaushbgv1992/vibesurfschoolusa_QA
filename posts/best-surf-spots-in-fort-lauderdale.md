# Best Surf Spots in Fort Lauderdale: A Local's Guide

Fort Lauderdale might not be the first place that comes to mind when thinking about premier surf destinations, but our beautiful coastline offers several excellent spots for catching waves. As local surf instructors who've spent countless hours in these waters, we're excited to share our insider knowledge of the best surf breaks in the area.

## Pompano Beach

Pompano Beach is our flagship location for a reason. The consistent sandbars create clean breaking waves that are perfect for beginners and intermediate surfers alike. The gentle slope of the ocean floor means waves break farther from shore, giving riders longer rides and more time to practice. 

**Best for:** Beginners and intermediates
**When to go:** Winter months (November to March) typically bring the best swells
**Local tip:** The area just north of the pier often has the cleanest breaks when there's a northeast swell

## Dania Beach Pier

The pier at Dania Beach creates a unique surf environment with sandbars that form excellent wave breaks. When conditions are right, you can catch some of the most consistent waves in Broward County here. The waves tend to be a bit more powerful than at Pompano, making this spot perfect for surfers looking to progress their skills.

**Best for:** Intermediate surfers
**When to go:** Best during north and northeast swells
**Local tip:** Always respect the local surfing etiquette around the pier and give right of way to surfers deeper in the wave

## Fort Lauderdale Beach (Commercial Pier)

This central spot is a popular gathering place for local surfers. The pier creates sandbars that help form rideable waves even when conditions elsewhere might be flat. The varying wave heights make it suitable for a range of skill levels.

**Best for:** All levels, depending on swell size
**When to go:** Works best with an easterly swell
**Local tip:** Early mornings usually offer the cleanest conditions before the sea breeze kicks in

## Sunny Isles Beach

Just south of Fort Lauderdale, Sunny Isles Beach offers another solid option for surfers. The wide beach provides plenty of space, and the wave breaks are typically gentler, making it another good spot for beginners and longboarders.

**Best for:** Beginners and longboarders
**When to go:** Winter swells, especially with north winds
**Local tip:** Check the forecast carefully - Hollywood needs specific conditions to really work well

## Surf Season in South Florida

While South Florida can have surf year-round, our prime season runs from late fall through early spring (October to March). During this time, cold fronts moving down from the north create consistent swells and favorable wind conditions.

Summer months can still offer surfable days, particularly during tropical systems (at a safe distance), but conditions are generally smaller and more suitable for beginners or longboarders.
